        // add ArrayList to enroll() method so that each course is added to a list //STATUS: DONE :)
        // instead of school level being a number change it to be a string with actual String level like "Junior" or "Freshmen" //STATUS: DONE :)
        //add feature where if the person pays way to much tuition then it will display message and give back the extra money paid //STATUS: DONE
        //put try catch where needed
        //if course entered is null or "" (blank) then do something //STATUS: DONE :)
        //add thread sleep to make sure it doesn't throw info all at once and does it line by line// STATUS: complete
        //school level should be int, if the user enters a string then display message of error // STATUS: complete
        //in the starting where it asks for the number of students to add, if user enters anything other than a int then it should give the user a message //STATUS: DONE :)
//        ----------------------------------

//        BIG BUG!!: make sure to make separate course lists for EACH student.

//      PRIORITY:

//        //check if school level is 1,2,3,4 cannot be some other int like 1234 , 4321 , 5 , 6 , etc //STATUS: PENDING



        //add minimum payment for tuition of $300 //STATUS: COMPLETE :)
        // PENDING //don't let user enter anything other then yes or no (don't let them enter int) when it asks "would you like to pay tuition"




        //check if the user that entered first name and last name is null or int //STATUS: PENDING

        //if no courses are enrolled then don't ask to pay tuition.
        //if no courses are enrolled then set ArrayList to String "none"

        //if user enters 0 for "How many students will you add: " then sout "Have a great day :)"
        // limit to adding new students should be 1,000, if user enters more than 1000 then sout "you cannot enter that many students"

        //in the end ask the user if they want to enroll their child in after school programs or any additional classes


        // add a login system in the beginning
